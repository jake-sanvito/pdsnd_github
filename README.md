You never do know what's around the bend
A big adventure or a brand new friend
When you're curious, like Curious George
(Swing)
When everyday (everyday) is so glorious (glorious)
Then everything (everything) is so wonderous (wonderous)
There's more to explore
When you open your door
And meet friends like this
You just can't miss
Get curious (curious) and that's marvelous (marvelous)
And that's your reward
You'll never be bored
If you ask yourself, what is this?
Like curious, like curious, Curious George


### Credits
